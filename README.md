## Welcome to my GitHub Page

Hello visitor! I am Kaushik Mishra and I am glad that you came across my page.

First off, I am a Ph.D. researcher in Center for Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences (CAOS) at the Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore, India. My current research interest lies in the large scale ocean modelling especially in the Indian Ocean and spanning to but not limited to local high resolution LES modelling as well. 

My background you ask? I have done my Bachelors in Mechanical Engineering from VIT University, Vellore, India. I was always interested in Fluids and their behaviour and my interest only piqued after I had exposure to courses like Turbomachinary, CFD and not only these, I also participated in the SAE collegiate aeromedelling competetion which gave me a very good basic exposure regarding fluid "mechanics".
